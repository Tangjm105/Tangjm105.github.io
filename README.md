There are two ways to run Tetriscript:

    1) Visit tangjm105.github.io where the Webpage is hosted.

    2) Place the six files for the project (index.html, styles.css, constants.js, board.js, piece.js, main.js) into a directory in VSCode, then install Live Server extension at https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer. Run Tetriscript by right-clicking on index.html and selecting the Open with Live Server option.


This Web application is very straight forward to use with no configurations or compilation required. Simply click on the Play button, move the tetrominoes with left, right, and down arrow keys, rotate with up arrow key, and drop the pieces with the space bar.
